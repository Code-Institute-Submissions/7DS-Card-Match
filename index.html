               <div class="text-box">Cards start facing down. On the other side of each card there is an image. There are two of each image that have been mixed up throughout the board.
                  Match the two images by turning one card over at a time. If the two cards flipped match, then they stay turned over; if they do not match, then they flip back over. Try to remember where the matching pairs are. 
                  For a challenge try to match all the cards in as little flips as possible.
